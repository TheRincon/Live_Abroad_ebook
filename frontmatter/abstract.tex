% the abstract

I am writing this guide and releasing it for \textit{free}, because I believe that the US is no longer the economic value proposition it used to be (putting it mildly). It is no longer the cost free, the "greatest country in the world", and families and individuals can do better than grinding it out there. I want others to experience the benefits of developed countries -- ones that don't squander wealth on war, countries that don't shower healthcare, prison systems, defense contractors, oil extractors and xenophobic farmers with money at the expense of common folk. 

I want to make it as simple as possible to move and start a new life -- one debt free, augmented with a fulfilling purpose, and plenty of time outside of work to enjoy the little things. If this book inspires even one person to get out of the US, leave the rat race, and acheive their dream of living in a more sane socity, then I consider these hours that I spent well worth it. 

You don't need to be rich, and you don't need to take out crazy loans (most readers might not need to take out loans at all). What you need is an open mind and a willingness to struggle for a bit.
